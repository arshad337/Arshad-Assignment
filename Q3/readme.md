Yes, Django signals are executed within the same database transaction as the caller. This means that if the transaction is rolled back, any database actions performed within the signal will also be undone

The user creation and signal execution happen inside an atomic block, ensuring transactional integrity.
When an exception is raised, the entire transaction is rolled back, including the signalâ€™s actions. This confirms that signals are part of the same transaction.
